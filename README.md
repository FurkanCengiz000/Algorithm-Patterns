# 🧠 Algorithm Patterns in PHP

This repository is a personal collection of LeetCode problems solved using **structured algorithmic patterns** in PHP.  
It’s designed to be clear, reusable, and focused on understanding **how** and **why** each solution works — not just getting the correct answer.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as:

- ✅ A personal learning journal of algorithmic thinking  
- ✅ A pattern-based study resource for live coding interviews  
- ✅ A clean and simple PHP implementation of well-known problems  
- ✅ A public portfolio to show structured problem-solving ability

## 🧩 Patterns Covered

| Pattern         | Problems                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🟦 Hash Table   | `Two Sum`, `Contains Duplicate`        |
| ⬜ Two Pointers | _Coming next..._                       |
| ⬜ Sliding Window | _TBD_                                |
| ⬜ Stack / Queue | _TBD_                                 |
| ⬜ Binary Search | _TBD_                                 |

> Each folder corresponds to one algorithm pattern and contains clear, commented PHP solutions.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `algorithm-patterns/`
    * `index.php` ← Mini file browser for convenience
    * `hashmap/`
        * `two-sum.php`
        * `contains-duplicate.php`
    * `two-pointers/`
        * `(coming soon...)`
    * `README.md`

You can visit `algorithm-patterns.test/` locally to browse and run any PHP file directly (using Laravel Herd or similar).

## 🧪 Each PHP file includes:

- ✅ Problem description (from LeetCode)  
- ✅ Time & space complexity  
- ✅ PHP solution (O(n) when possible)  
- ✅ Local test case to run and verify

## 🚀 Usage

To run any file from terminal:

```bash
php hashmap/two-sum.php
```

Or open in browser (if using Herd):
